# android-tv-browser-autolaunch

An Android TV App (react-native) that auto-launches on boot and shows a browser with a hard-coded URL.

Useful for running a dedicated browser on a TV using a cheap Android TV box.
We use it to run a Google Docs presentation on a TV at our tabletennis club TTV Flash.
